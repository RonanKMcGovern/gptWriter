Here is the updated JSON command to reflect the changes:
```
{
  "csv_file": "crmInput.csv",
  "search_value": "ABC Company",
  "update_key": "Address",
  "update_value": "35 River Court, Philadelphia"
}
```
The updated JSON command specifies that we want to update the `Address` field of the record whose `Company` field has the value `"ABC Company"` to `"35 River Court, Philadelphia"`.
