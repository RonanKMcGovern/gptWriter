Here is the updated JSON stringified input data after applying your command: 

```
{
    "csv_file": "crmInput.csv",
    "search_value": "XYZ Corporation",
    "update_key": "Status",
    "update_value": "Phenomenal Sale"
}
``` 

Please note that this is just a stringified JSON output, and you will need to implement the actual update logic in your database based on this output.
